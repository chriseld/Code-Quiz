# Code-Quiz
A timed quiz application written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## About
This quiz application presents the user with a responsive, multiple-choice, timed JavaScript quiz. When a question is answered incorrectly, extra time is removed from the timer. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, the user is presented with their remaining time as a score. If the user has set a new high score, they are prompted to enter their initials. The initials and score are then saved to localstorage and displayed on future game starts.
